# SF-Crime-Data-Analysis
Perform Data Analysis for San Francisco Crime Data in Apache Spark

San Francisco as one of the largest cities on the West Coast, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center. Everyday, millions of arties, businessman and travelers come to the city. The most import question in their mind is whether San Francisco is safe or not. My analysis is to better understand the crime pattern in San Francisco so that we can have a more constructive advice to our travelers and to our policy makers. 

The first part of this project is OLAP for sf crime data analysis 
The second part is unsupervised learning for spatial data analysis.
